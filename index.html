    <h1>My Material Design Component</h1>
    <p>This button was created using Material Design Components for the Web</p>
    <p>As a side note, all Material Design Web Components were written using Lit under the covers, just like the web component above.</p>
    <p>Go ahead, click it. You'll see a nice ripple effect.</p>
    
    <button class="mdc-button foo-button">
        <div class="mdc-button__ripple"></div>
        <span class="mdc-button__label">Button</span>
    </button>

    <h4>More notes about this button:</h4>
    <p>This button was deployed to this page using un-natural acts :) </p>
    <p>A front end coder would not deploy such a page without using build tools, npm dependencies, and the like. So some
        of the code used to deploy this Material Design component is weird stuff you wouldn't see in a normal usage.
        Mainly, this line `mdc.ripple.MDCRipple.attachTo(document.querySelector('.foo-button'));` WUT?</p>
    <p>The win? You get to see it all in one html page with no other js, css or other files to confuse you.</p>

        //Is this the whole code for making a web component with lit? Yup. 
        //Now you have a <my-component> you can consume in your web page.
