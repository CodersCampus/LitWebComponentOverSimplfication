# Lit Web Components Demo
This is close to the simplest possible Web Component that can be built with Lit, and deployed to an html page.

Also shown is another demo, using a Material Design web component deployed to the same page as a demo.

## Un-natural acts

You would never write a real web component like this. In that sense, this is an 'un-natural act' that humans should never do.

Instead you would have a very complex project structure like [this project](https://github.com/CodersCampus/WebComponentStarterExampleTypeScript) even for the simplest Web Component. This has nothing to do with Web Components specifically. All client side coding with javascript dependencies shares this same tool-heavy approach.

Similarly, you would never deploy a Material Design component from a CDN like this. It would be a part of a deployment structure such as [this](https://github.com/CodersCampus/WebComponentStarterExampleTypeScript) or [this](https://github.com/CodersCampus/11tyStarterExample)

## Why do this the un-natural way, then?

This is a teaching example only. By removing the normal coding and build infrastructure it shows you the most essential code only.


## How to launch this code

From the command prompt

```bash
open index.html
```

Or if you prefer to skip the above command prompt approach, go to your browser, `File Open` and navigate to the `index.html` in this project.
